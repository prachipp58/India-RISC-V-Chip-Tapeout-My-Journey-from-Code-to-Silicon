# India-RISC-V-Chip-Tapeout-My-Journey-from-Code-to-Silicon
My participation in the India RISC-V Chip Tapeout Program is a commitment to a larger mission: to deeply understand the principles of VLSI design and contribute to India's "Silicon to Sovereignty" initiative. This repository serves as a personal portfolio, showcasing my learning, challenges, and successes on this journey.
