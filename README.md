## Week 0: The Foundry - Building the Foundation

### **Objective**
The objective of this week was to establish a fully functional open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) environment. This foundational step is critical, as a well-configured environment is the bedrock for all subsequent design and implementation. The machine configuration used for this task was **6GB RAM**, **50GB HDD**, **Ubuntu 20.04**, and **4vCPU**.
