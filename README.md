## üíª Day 4: Comprehensive Analysis of Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

Day 4 focused on **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**, a crucial verification step after synthesis, with the primary goal of demonstrating and debugging the **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch** caused by incorrect RTL coding practices.

***

## 1. üß™ Experiment: Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch and Netlist Validation

This experiment demonstrates a synthesis-simulation mismatch caused by using an **incorrect or incomplete sensitivity list** in the combinatorial `always` block of the design file, `bad_mux.v`. This type of error causes the Verilog simulator to behave differently from the physical netlist.

### Step 1: Pre-Synthesis (RTL) Simulation (RTL Pass - Misleading)

The initial simulation of the original RTL code (`bad_mux.v`) runs successfully, masking the underlying bug.

| Command Sequence | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| ```bash iverilog ../my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v bad_mux.v tb_bad_mux.v ./a.out ``` | **RTL PASS:** The simulator follows its internal scheduling rules, honoring the explicit (but incorrect) sensitivity list. The output appears **functionally correct**, misleading the designer. |
---

### Step 2: Synthesis and Netlist Analysis

Yosys synthesizes the flawed RTL. Instead of inferring a latch (the classic error), the tool correctly infers purely combinatorial logic (a MUX) but flags the incorrect sensitivity list as a warning.

| Yosys Log Highlight | Implication |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Note:** `Recommending use of @* instead of @(...)` | Confirms the use of an incomplete sensitivity list, which is the **RTL bug**. |
| **Check:** `No latch inferred for signal \bad_mux.\y'` | Confirms the netlist contains **purely combinatorial logic** (`sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1`), meaning the hardware updates instantly with any input change. |
---

### Step 3: Post-Synthesis (GLS) Simulation (GLS Fail - Mismatch Exposed)

The Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) using the synthesized netlist (`synth_bad_mux.v`) exposes the functional mismatch between the ideal RTL simulation and the actual netlist behavior.

| Command Sequence | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| ```bash # Run GLS on the synthesized netlist iverilog ../my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v synth_bad_mux.v tb_bad_mux.v ./a.out ``` | **GLS FAIL (Mismatch):** The **Netlist (GLS)** output updates **instantly** when any input changes (correct hardware behavior). The overlaid **RTL waveform** shows a **functional failure** or **delayed update** where the output failed to update instantly due to the missing signal in the sensitivity list. |
---

### üõë Final Conclusion and Verification Status

The experiment successfully demonstrated the critical nature of the **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**. The initial **RTL Simulation passed (‚úÖ)**, but the subsequent **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) failed (‚ùå)** to match the RTL, proving that the **missing signal in the sensitivity list** led to functionally incorrect hardware behavior compared to the flawed simulator model. The correct fix is to use **`always @*`** in the RTL.
## üß™ Experiment 2: Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch (Blocking Assignments in Sequential Logic)

This experiment demonstrates a major functional error caused by incorrectly using **blocking assignments (`=`)** within a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block in the file **`blocking_caveat.v`**. This causes a mismatch because the simulator executes the assignments sequentially, while the synthesizer infers parallel D-Flip-Flops (DFFs), losing the intended sequential flow (e.g., a shift register).

### Step 1: Pre-Synthesis (RTL) Simulation (RTL Pass - Misleading)

The RTL code, using blocking assignments (`=`), passes the simulation check, masking the bug.

| Command Sequence | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| ```bash iverilog ../my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v blocking_caveat.v tb_blocking_caveat.v ./a.out VCD info: dumpfile tb_blocking_caveat.vcd opened for output. tb_blocking_caveat.v:24: $finish called at 3000000 (1ps) ``` | **RTL PASS:** Simulator executes assignments **sequentially** (correcting the designer's intent) and the logic appears functional (e.g., shifting) in simulation. |

### Step 2: Synthesis and Netlist Analysis

The synthesizer (Yosys) correctly infers **parallel D-Flip-Flops (DFFs)** based on the clock edge, **ignoring the sequential effect** of the blocking assignment operator (`=`).

| Synthesis Step | Implication |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Yosys Flow:** `synth -top blocking_caveat` | Yosys will infer **parallel DFFs** (using `$dff` cells) because it correctly ignores the sequential semantics of the blocking operator in a clocked block. |
| **Netlist Structure:** Parallel DFFs | The netlist will feature **parallel DFFs**, destroying the intended sequential dependency (e.g., the shifting action). |
---

### Step 3: Post-Synthesis (GLS) Simulation (GLS Fail - Mismatch Exposed)

The GLS on the synthesized netlist (`synth_blocking_caveat.v`) will expose the functional failure, demonstrating the mismatch between the intended sequential flow and the synthesized parallel hardware.

| Command Sequence | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| ```bash # Run GLS on the synthesized netlist iverilog ... sky130_fd_sc_hd.v synth_blocking_caveat.v tb_blocking_caveat.v ./a.out ``` | **GLS FAIL (Mismatch):** The **Netlist (GLS)** output exhibits **parallel behavior** (all DFFs updating from the same source) instead of the intended sequential/shift register behavior. |

### üõë Final Conclusion for Experiment 2

The experiment successfully demonstrated the functional failure caused by the **synthesis-simulation mismatch**. The intended sequential behavior was corrupted during synthesis because the **blocking assignment operator (`=`)** was used in a clocked block.

| Status | Result | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mismatch Status** | **GLS Failed (‚ùå)** | Replace all blocking assignments (`=`) with **non-blocking assignments (`<=`)** in sequential (`always @(posedge clk)`) blocks. |

## üíª Day 5: RTL Optimization and Synthesis Best Practices

Day 5 focused on advanced RTL coding practices essential for efficient synthesis, primarily analyzing how complex structures like conditional statements (`if-else`, `case`) and repetition constructs (`generate`) map to efficient hardware. The central objective was to understand the synthesis tool's interpretation and **eliminate unintentional latch inference** and **avoid area/timing bottlenecks**.

## 1. üõë Synthesis Caveat 1: Avoiding Unintentional Latch Inference

The first set of labs highlighted the critical error of writing **incomplete combinatorial logic**, which forces the synthesizer (Yosys) to infer latches. Latches are generally undesirable in synchronous design because they complicate timing analysis.

### Observation: Incomplete Conditional Logic

| RTL Construct | Synthesis Implication | Verification Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incomplete `if-else`** (Missing final `else`) | The output variable is not assigned under all possible conditions. Yosys is forced to infer a **Transparent Latch** to hold the previous value. | **GLS Failure (‚ùå)** |
| **Incomplete `case`** (Missing `default` case) | The output state is ambiguous when the selector doesn't match any defined case. This also results in a **Transparent Latch** inference. | **GLS Failure (‚ùå)** |

### Best Practice üí°
Always use the **`always @*`** syntax and ensure every output signal is assigned a value in **all branches** of the conditional logic (`if/else` or `case/default`) within a combinatorial block.

## 2. ‚ö° Synthesis Caveat 2: Structure vs. Performance (`if` vs. `case`)

This experiment analyzed the hardware structures resulting from priority-based versus parallel conditional logic, showing how RTL choice directly impacts the resulting critical path.

### Observation: Priority Encoding vs. Parallelism

| RTL Construct | Hardware Mapping | Performance Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cascading `if-else if`** | Maps directly to a **Priority Encoder Chain**. The first condition has the highest priority. | **Slower (Critical Path)** increases linearly with the number of conditions, as each stage must wait for the previous one to fail. |
| **`case` Statement** | Maps to a highly parallel **Multiplexer (MUX) Tree** structure. | **Faster (Area/Speed Trade-off)**. Provides near-simultaneous evaluation, resulting in a shallower, faster logic path. |

### Best Practice üí°
Use **`case` statements** (and ensure they are complete) for decoding parallel/mutually exclusive conditions, and restrict cascading **`if-else if`** logic only where genuine priority is required.

## 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Synthesis Best Practice: Scalability with `generate`

The final lab series focused on generating highly repetitive and scalable hardware structures using **`for generate`** blocks, a crucial technique for large-scale physical design.

### Observation: Compile-Time Instantiation

| RTL Construct | Execution Time | Synthesizable Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard `for` loop** | Runtime (Simulation only) | Used for control/sequencing in a testbench or sequential block. **Not synthesizable for hardware replication.** |
| **`for generate`** | **Compile-time** (Synthesis only) | Essential for creating **parallel arrays** of hardware (e.g., registers, adders, I/O buffers) by instantiating modules based on a loop count. |

### Best Practice üí°
For creating scalable, repetitive parallel hardware‚Äîsuch as the array of DFFs demonstrated in the lab‚Äîthe **`for generate`** loop with a **`genvar`** must be used. This allows the synthesizer to efficiently replicate the target standard cells across the netlist.

# üéì Week 1 Key Learnings: From RTL to Synthesis Optimization

This week covered the fundamental digital VLSI flow, emphasizing practical RTL coding for efficient hardware synthesis using the **Sky130 PDK** and **Yosys**.

## 1. ‚öôÔ∏è Core Synthesis & Mapping
* **Translation:** Successfully converted abstract RTL into technology-specific gate-level netlists using **Yosys** and the **ABC mapper**.
* **Foundation:** Confirmed functional equivalence of basic combinatorial and sequential designs (MUX, D-FFs) after mapping to **Sky130 standard cells**.

## 2. ‚ùå Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch (The Debug Focus)
* **Sensitivity Error:** Demonstrated that incomplete combinatorial logic (`always @(...)` missing signals) leads to **GLS failure (‚ùå)**, requiring the use of **`always @*`** or complete assignment coverage.
* **Sequential Error:** Proved that using **blocking assignments (`=`)** in clocked (`always @(posedge clk)`) blocks destroys intended sequential logic (like shift registers), confirming the mandate for **non-blocking assignments (`<=`)**.

## 3. üí° RTL Optimization & Best Practices
* **Latch Avoidance:** Learned that failing to assign an output in all conditional branches (`if/else` or `case/default`) forces the synthesizer to infer an unwanted **Latch**.
* **Performance:** Understood that deep **`if-else if`** chains create slow **Priority Encoder** logic, favoring parallel **`case` statements** for speed.
* **Scalability:** Mastered the **`for generate`** construct, essential for creating scalable, parallel hardware arrays (e.g., arrays of DFFs) at compile-time.

## Part I: Conceptual Foundations of SoC Design

### I. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an **integrated circuit (IC)** that integrates *all* or most components of a computer or other electronic system into a **single silicon chip**. This architecture provides critical benefits for modern electronics, such as smaller size, lower power consumption, and improved performance due to component proximity.

#### Anatomy of a Typical SoC üß†

A typical SoC is a complex architecture made up of four primary, interconnected blocks:

1.  **CPU (Central Processing Unit) / Processor Core:** The computational "brain" responsible for executing software instructions and controlling the system.
2.  **Memory Subsystem:** Includes different types of memory (like SRAM and DRAM) and the necessary controllers for storing code and data for the CPU.
3.  **Peripherals:** These are specialized Input/Output (I/O) blocks that enable the SoC to interact with the outside world and perform specific functions (e.g., UARTs, Timers, ADCs).
4.  **Interconnect:** The communication highway (Bus or Network-on-Chip) that allows all the components (CPU, memory, peripherals) to efficiently transfer data.

### II. Why BabySoC is Your Learning Supertool üë∂üíª

The **BabySoC** is a **simplified model** designed specifically for learning core SoC concepts.

A full commercial SoC is overwhelming due to the sheer complexity of integrating dozens of heterogeneous components and advanced interconnect standards (like AMBA AXI).

**BabySoC strips away this complexity**, offering a focused, bite-sized environment:

* It contains the **core architectural elements** (CPU, Memory, simplified Peripherals, and an Interconnect) in a minimal configuration.
* It allows us to **clearly observe the data flow** and interaction between components, making fundamental concepts tangible.
* It provides a **safe, contained environment** to practice essential skills like functional modelling and verification before tackling industrial-scale systems.

In essence, BabySoC acts as the **ideal training platform** to build foundational knowledge in SoC development.

### III. The Critical Role of Functional Modelling üìù

**Functional modelling** is an essential step that occurs **before** the **RTL (Register-Transfer Level) design** and **physical design** stages.

Its primary goal is to **verify the system's intended behavior** and **correctness** at a high level of abstraction, acting as the **"measure twice, cut once"** phase of chip design.

| Design Stage | Focus | Key Role (Why it's essential) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Functional Modelling** | *What* the system should do. High-level algorithm and system architecture. | **Fast verification** of the design specification and system architecture *before* committing to hardware structure. |
| **2. RTL Design** | *How* the system implements the function using registers and logic gates (Verilog/VHDL code). | Specifies the hardware logic for synthesis. |
| **3. Physical Design** | *Where* the transistors are placed on the silicon chip (Layout, timing closure). | Creates the final manufacturable silicon mask. |

By using tools like **Icarus Verilog** for simulation and **GTKWave** for waveform visualization, we ensure that the BabySoC's logic is **functionally correct** *before* wasting significant time and resources on developing the full RTL description or moving to physical layout.

## Part II: Hands-on Functional Verification

### 2.1 Toolchain Setup and TLV Conversion

The RVMYTH core is written in **TL-Verilog (.tlv)**, which requires conversion to standard Verilog before simulation.

| Step | Command Executed | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. TLV Conversion** | `sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --outdir ./src/module/` | Translates the high-level RVMYTH source into standard RTL. |
| **2. Compilation** | `iverilog -o output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM ...` | Compiles the Testbench, RVMYTH, PLL, and DAC modules into an executable binary. |
| **3. Simulation** | `./pre_synth_sim.out` | Executes the binary, running the CPU's program and generating the `pre_synth_sim.vcd` waveform file. |
